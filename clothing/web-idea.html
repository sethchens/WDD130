        <h3>Why will people come to your site?</h3>
        This website is designed to give the people an ideal web-browsing experience, 
        which is seperate the activity or sales info from the main page and put them 
        into a independent sub page. 
    </p><br>
    <p>
        <h3>What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?</h3>
        Maybe some of the customers may wonder, "Then how can I know what is on sale and when the
        promotion starts?" To respond this, the website will have a prompt to have customers know 
        how to navigate to the activity page. For the on-sale products, instead of have bothering ads 
        all around the main page, we simply but a tag under the discription of the product. 
    </p><br>

        <h3>What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site?</h3>
        The cusmtomers can browse the website with a "calm" mind. If you just want to view what we have, 
        all you need to do is stay at the ain page. What if some want to get a good deal? They can just 
        navigate as prompted to the activity page. 
    </p><br>
    <p>
        <h3>What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers?</h3>
        A good designed prompting without bothering the users. A clear on sales tag under each product.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        <h3>Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions?</h3>
        Becaue in these days, pretty much all the website want customers see the activity info once they open 
        the website, and this actually keeps more and more users from visiting the website. To change this problem 
        and get customers back to a pleased brwosing experience, we decided to make this modification.

    <h4>All in all, this will be a two-page website if it is ok. Main and the second page(promo info).</h4>
