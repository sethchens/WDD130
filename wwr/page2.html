                The Volga is the longest river in Europe, and its catchment area is 
                almost entirely inside Russia, though the longest river in Russia is the Irtysh 
                river system. It belongs to the closed basin of the Caspian Sea, being the longest 
                river to flow into a closed basin. Rising in the Valdai Hills 225 meters (738 ft) above
                sea level northwest of Moscow and about 320 kilometers (200 mi) southeast of Saint Petersburg, 
                the Volga heads east past Lake Sterzh, Tver, Dubna, Rybinsk, Yaroslavl, Nizhny Novgorod, and Kazan.
                 
                From there it turns south, flows past Ulyanovsk, Tolyatti, Samara, Saratov and Volgograd, 
                and discharges into the Caspian Sea below Astrakhan at 28 meters (92 ft) below sea level. 
                At its most strategic point, it bends toward the Don ("the big bend"). Volgograd, formerly Stalingrad, 
                is located there.

                The Tigris is 1,750 km (1,090 mi) long, rising in the Taurus Mountains of eastern Turkey about 
                25 km (16 mi) southeast of the city of Elazığ and about 30 km (20 mi) from the headwaters of the Euphrates. 
                The river then flows for 400 km (250 mi) through Southeastern Turkey before becoming part of the Syria-Turkey border. 
                This stretch of 44 km (27 mi) is the only part of the river that is located in Syria.[2] Some of its affluences are Garzan, 
                Anbarçayi, Batman, and the Great and the Little Zab. Close to its confluence with the Euphrates, the Tigris splits into several channels. 

                The artificial Shatt al-Hayy branches off, to join the Euphrates near Nasiriyah. Second, the Shatt al-Muminah and Majar al-Kabir branch 
                off to feed the Central Marshes. Further downstream, two other distributary channels branch off (the Al-Musharrah and Al-Kahla), 
                to feed the Hawizeh Marshes. The main channel continues southwards and is joined by the Al-Kassarah, which drains the Hawizeh Marshes.

                The Yenisey, also romanised as Yenisei, Enisei, or Jenisej, is the fifth-longest river system in the world, and the largest 
                to drain into the Arctic Ocean. Rising in Mungaragiyn-gol in Mongolia, it follows a northerly course before draining into the Yenisey Gulf 
                in the Kara Sea. The Yenisey divides the Western Siberian Plain in the west from the Central Siberian Plateau to the east; it drains a large 
                part of central Siberia.

                It is the central one of three large Siberian rivers that flow into the Arctic Ocean (the other two being the Ob and the Lena).   
                The maximum depth of the Yenisey is 24 metres (80 ft) and the average depth is 14 metres (45 ft). The depth of river outflow is 32 metres (106 ft) 
                and inflow is 31 metres (101 ft).
