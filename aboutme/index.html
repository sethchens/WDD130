    <h2>Seth Chen</h2>
    <h2>I don't have a nickname</h2>
    <p>I'm from Taiwan, and this is my second semester here study in Data Science for BS in BYUI. 
    I love badminton, piano, art, drawing, and gaming. I'm still single, and am current
    working in BYUI IT Support Team.</p>
    <p>I actually love the vibe here. It's really chill and relaxing. For now I'm still figureing 
    out which way to go for my carrer, but I just try to 
    learn everything about programing and to see which path I should be on. I've been a memeber 
    of the church since I was born. All my family are members. My mom, my brother, and I did 
    serve our mission. </p>
